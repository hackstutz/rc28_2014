We outline recent developments in Switzerland regarding income and income inequality using data on an individual and community level. We find ... You can find more information and visualizations at our project website: \texttt{http://inequalities.ch}.
}

\headerbox{Data}{name=data,column=1,row=0}{
We use two different data sets. On a community level our data are provided by the Swiss Federal Tax Administration. Individual data were collected with the help of the cantonal tax administrations of Aargau and Obwalden. Our variable of interest is inequality of income: a Gini coefficient we derive from \texttt{taxable income} which is the sum of all sorts of income (wages, dividends, rent, etc.) minus all possible deductions.
