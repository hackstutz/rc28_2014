# Inequality of incomes  in Switzerland

## The Kuznet-Curve and the role of sectoral change

While analysing income inequality using US tax data in the 1950s, Simon Kuznet found a relationship between sectoral change from agrarian to industrial economy and income inequality. Out of his observation he formulated a "law" which is know today as the Kuznets-curve. The "law" in its more general form postulates that income inequality rises at the beginning of a major structural change. This change is driven by the demand of skilled labour forces, which surplus the supply at the beginning of the change, which temporarily leads to higher income inequality. Later on, when labor demand and supply found an equilibrium,  income inequality again drops. Because of the simplicity of the argument this "law" is still a relevant starting point for scholars investigating income inequality, even though there exist other factors which affect income inequality.

## Research Question

Following the ideas of Kuznet, we explore how sectoral change affected income inequality in Switzerland. We lay our focus on the last decades (1990 to 2010), where Switzerland observed a major shift from industrial to service based economy. How is the structural change of Swiss economy associated to income inequality in Switzerland?

## Data and Method

In the tradition of Kuznet we work with tax data from Swiss Federal Tax Administration and with tax data, which we collected from Swiss cantonal tax authorities. The data is collected within [a research project about inequality in income and wealth in Switzerland](http://www.inequalities.ch), which is financed by the [Swiss National Science Fondation](http://www.snf.ch). Because tax data covers the whole population of Switzerland, it allows us to analyse income inequality without sample bias from non-response. To make the data accessable in a "playful" manner, we programmed several interactive graphs, which allows interested persons to explore the data on their own.
